# Standardizing Documentation Terminology with GitHub Copilot Vale
## Introduction
 A few months ago, I was reviewing a documentation update when I noticed something small but frustrating. One section said sign in, another said log in, and yet another had login as one word. It wasn’t a huge issue, but these little inconsistencies add up over time, making documentation messy and confusing for users.

At first, I thought, Okay, I’ll just remind everyone to use the same term. But the more I looked, the more I realized how often these tiny inconsistencies slipped through. I started wondering if there was a way to automate this.

After some research, I found a combination that actually works. **GitHub Copilot** and **Vale** can automatically check for terminology inconsistencies and keep our docs clean without extra effort. Vale acts like a proofreader, flagging issues before they make it into the docs. GitHub Actions runs these checks on every pull request. This setup makes terminology enforcement effortless and helps everyone focus on writing clear and useful content.

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?
Let’s be real, keeping documentation consistent is hard. One writer says **sign in**, another says **log in**, and suddenly users are confused. We’ve all been there!
#### This project is here to solve that chaos
Our goal is to make terminology consistency effortless for everyone—writers, developers, and even your future self. Here’s how we’ll do it together:
- Kill terminology chaos. No more **sign in** vs. **log in** debates. Let’s agree on one term and stick to it.
- Build a shared style guide (TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md) that’s actually useful. Think of it as your team’s **rulebook** for words.
- Automate the annoying stuff. Vale acts like a friendly proofreader, catching sneaky inconsistencies before they go live.
- Let bots do the grunt work. GitHub Actions runs checks on every PR, so you don’t have to play **term police** in code reviews.
- Make it a team effort. Everyone can tweak the guide, suggest new terms, and own the process. Good docs need everyone’s voice.
